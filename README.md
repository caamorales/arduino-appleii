# arduino-appleii

Emulate the Apple II Microcomputer / 6502 on an Arduino Uno.
To be used in conjuction with video generation code in my arduino-vga repository.

Currently somewhere between 5 and 8 times slower than real hardware, however the
arduino is maybe 16-32x the speed of the original mos6502 CPU. Should be possible
to tighten things up and reach realtime.

Feel free to play arround!
